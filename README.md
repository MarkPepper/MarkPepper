- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarkPepper
- I am a mathematics student with a 2:1 BA from the University of Cambridge.
- I am now studying for a masters at King's College London.

- So although I spend a majority of my time doing analysis, I am interested in Machine Learning and Data. Having dabbled in statistics and
  Machine Learning throughout my student days, I realised I had never actually done any coding.

- So here I am. I will also link my kaggle account once I have done a few more project and am no longer embarrassed by it! 


- Please reach out to me, not for help because I won't be able to help, but to work with me if you have a cool maths/data problem!
